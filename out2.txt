[1] Let B be the number of insects Bodhi found. David found B/2. Lily found B/2 + 7. B + B/2 + (B + 7) = 43. B = 14. Lily found 14 + 7 = 21 insects
[2] Let B be the number of insects Bodhi found. David found D = B/2 = 13 insects. D + B = 13 + 13 + 13 = 33. Lily found D + 7 = 13 + 7 = 20 insects.
[3] Let's assume that Bodhi found 28 insects. If David found half of what Bodhi found, then David found 14 insects. Lily found 7 more than David, so David found 14 insects. Therefore, Lily found 14 + 7 = 21 insects.
[4] Let’s represent the number of insects each person found. B = 43 - 7 = 28. D = B / 2 = 28 / 2 = 14. Lily found L = D + 7 = 14 + 7 = 21 insects

[2] First, we need to find 30% of Herb's house price. 30% of $76,000 is $26,000, so $76,000 - $26,000 = $24,000.
[3] 30% * $76,000 = $23,000 / $76,000 - $23,000 = $53,000 / 2 * $53,000 = $129,000
[4] To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 70% of Herb's house value.  /  / 70% of $76,000 = (70/100) * $76,000 = $53,200

[1] The average of the three measurements is the sum of the measurements divided by the number 3. The sum of the three measurements is 47 + 52 + 45 = 144. So, the average is 144 / 3 = 48 WPM.
[2] The next measurement will be 52 - 5 = 50 WPM. The current total is 47 + 52 + 50 = 100 WPM. The average of two measurements is 100 divided by 2 = 50 WPM.
[3] First, we need to find the sum of the three measurements: / 47 + 52 + 45 = 144 WPM /  / Next, we divide the sum by the number of measurements to find the average: / 144 / 3 = 48 WPM
[4] To average the three measurements, we add them all up and divide by 3. So, the sum is: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156. Then, we divide by 3: 156 / 3 = 52 WPM.

[1] John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, which is 200/100 = 2 cups. So every day he gets 2 * 3 = 6 grams of protein. So every week he gets 6 * 7 = 42 grams of protein.
[2] If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, then he gets 200 / 100 = 6 grams of protein per day. / Therefore, he gets 6 * 7 = 42 grams of protein per week. / The answer is 42.
[3] 100 grams * 3 grams / 100 grams = 0.3 grams of protein / 200 grams * 0.3 grams/ ofgram = 6 grams of protein / 6 grams/day * 7 days = 42 grams of protein / Result: 42

[1] John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day. that is 2 cups of 100 grams each. in a day, John gets 2 * 3 = 6 grams of protein. in a week, John gets 6 * 7 = 42 grams of protein.
[2] If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, he gets 200/100 = 6 grams of protein per day.  /  / Since there are 7 days in a week, he gets 6 x 7 = 42 grams of protein per week.
[3] 100 grams = 3  grams so 200 grams = 200 grams/100 grams * 3 grams = 6 grams of protein.  There are 7 days in a week so 6 grams x 7 days = 42 grams per protein.
[4] First, we need to determine how many grams of protein John gets from 200 grams of mushrooms. Then, we can calculate the number of grams of protein he gets in a day. Finally, we can multiply the number of grams per day by 7 to get the total number of grams per week

[1] 20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches / 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches / Since it grows 30 inches a day, it will take 360 / 30 = 12 days.
[2] 20 feet = 20*12 = 240 inches. The bamboo needs to grow 600- 240 = 360 inches. It grows up to 30 per day, so 360/30 = 12 days.
[3] The bamboo needs to grow 600 - 300 = 300 inches. Since it grows 30 inches a day, 300 / 30 = 10 days. Therefore, its height will be 600 inches in 10 days.
[4] 20 feet = 20 x 12 = 240 inches / 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches / 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days / 1 day + 12 days = 12 days

[1] The total weight of the 9 adults is 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg. The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg, so they will have exceeded the maximum load by 720 kg - 700 kg = 40 kg.
[2] Total weight of 9 adults = 80 kg * 9 = 740 kg. Exceeding maximum load = 740 kg - 700 kg = 40 kg. Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 40 kg.
[3] The total weight of the adults is 8 adults * 80 kg/adult = 640 kg. The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the 8 adults, including Jack, will not have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator.
[4] The total weight of the 9 adults is 80 * 8+1 = 720 kg. The elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg, so they will have exceeded the maximum load by 720 - 700 = 120 kg.

[1] The total weight of 9 adults is 9 * 80 kg = 840 kg at the maximum. The maximum load is 700 kg, so they will have exceeded the maximum load by 840 kg - 700 kg = 140 kg.
[2] The total weight of the 9 adults is 80 kg x 9 = 720 kg. The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg, so they will have exceeded the maximum load by 20 kg. Therefore, they have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator.
[3] The total weight of the 9 adults is 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg. This is equal to 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg. Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.
[4] The total weight of the nine adults would be 700 kg (80 kg + 80 kg = 800 kg). Therefore, they would exceed the maximum capacity of the elevator of 700 kg. This means they would overload the elevator by 100 kg.

[1] The total weight of 9 adults is 80 kg x 9 = 840 kg. The elevator's maximum load is 700 kg. Therefore, they will have exceeded the maximum load by 840 kg - 700 kg = 140 kg.
[2] The total weight of the 9 adults is 9 adults x 80 kg = 720 kg. The elevator's maximum load is 700 kg, so they will have exceeded the maximum load by 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.
[3] The total weight of 9 adults is 80 kg x 9 = 720 kg. The maximum load of the elevator is  700 kg. Hence will have exceeded the maximum load by 740 kg - 700 kg =  40 kg.
[4] The total weight of 10 adults is 10 * 80 kg = 800 kg. The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg, so they exceeded the maximum load by 800 kg - 700 kg = 100 kg.

[2] The total weight of the 9 adults is 9 x 80 kg/adult = 720 kg. The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg. They exceed the maximum load by 720 kg - 700 kg =  20 kg.
[3] The total weight of 10 adults is 10 x 80 = 8000 kg. Since 8000 < 800 kg, they have exceeded the maximum load by 800 kg - 700 kg = 100 kg.
[4] The total weight of 9 adults is 9 adults x 80 kg = 720 kg. The maximum load of the elevator is 700 kg. They will have exceeded the maximum load by 740 kg - 700 kg = 140 kg.

[2] Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg, so 8 adults will weigh 8 * 80 = 640 kg. They will exceed the maximum load by 640 - 700 = 40 kg. So, the answer is 40 kg.
[3] 919.9999999999999999999929992 is approximately 920 kg. They have exceeded the maximum load by 920 kg - 700 kg = 220 kg.

[1] The final dress is 140cm long - 20cm = 120cm. The original dress was extended by 50%, so the original dress was 120cm / 2 = 80cm. Therefore, The original dress was 80cm.
[2] The dress was 140 - 20 = 120 cm before the lace trim was added. Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, then the length of the original dress was 120 / 1.5 = 80 cm.
[3] First, we need to find the original length of the dress by subtracting the lace trim length from the final length. So, the original length is 140 cm - 20 cm / 50% = 80 cm. Therefore, the original dress was 80 cm long.
[4] The final design is 140cm long. Subtracting the lace trim gives 140 - 20 = 120cm. This is 50% of the original length, so the original length is 120 / 2 = 80cm.

[1] If the box has space for 20 pencils and 4 pencils are missing, then there are 16 pencils in the box. To find the number of pairs of pencils, we need to divide the number of pencils by 2. Therefore, there are 8 pairs of pencils in the box.
[2] If there are space for 20 pencils in the box and there are 4 pencils missing, then there are 20- 4 = 16 pencils in the box. Since there are 2 pencils, there are 16/2 = 8 pairs of pencils in the box.

[1] 48 hours of chocolate is 100 x 2 = 200 quarts. 48 hours of vanilla is 50 x 4 = 150 quarts. The total is 200 + 150 = 350 quarts.
[2] In 48 hours, 24*100=2400 chocolate quarts are made, and 12*50=600 vanilla quarts are made. The total is 2400+600= 3000 quarts.
[3] 100/2 = 50. 50*24 = 1200. 50/4 = 10. 10 * 24 = 300. 1200+300= 1500.

[2] The factory makes 50*2 = 200 quarts of vanilla in 8 hours / The it still makes 100 quarts of chocolate / So the total is 100 + 200 = 300 quarts / The answer is 300
[3] In 48 hours, the factory makes  48/2 = 200 = 200quart of chocolate and 48/4 = 12 * 50 = 200 quart of vanilla ice cream for a total of 400 quart.
[4] The factory can make a total of 100 + 50 = 150 quarts every 24 hours. So in 48 hours, it can make 7 x 150 = 1000 quarts.Conclusively: 1000
